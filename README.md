# Modeling RNA Binding Protein Regulatory Interactions and Expression Networks within Ovarian Cancer and Breast Cancer Single Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA) Datasets

**_Abstract_**: High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) is one of the deadliest forms of ovarian cancer, leading as the 8th most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Genomically, HGSOC is characterized by p53 mutations and instability within pathways pertaining to DNA repair. Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is representative of 10%-15% of all diagnosed breast cancer patients and is known for its manifestation of chemotherapeutic cisplatin resistance. RNA Binding Proteins (RBP) are proteins that modulate several cellular pathways and structures, via post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory interactions. Dysregulated RBPs have shown to promote the metastasis and growth of both ovarian and breast cancers, thus suggesting the need for greater knowledge of RBP-target interactions and expression models within HGSOC and TNBC. Furthermore, RBP regulation has shown great involvement in cisplatin resistance within TNBC, thus reasoning the exploration of RBP-targets in cisplatin-treated samples. scRNA sequencing is a genomic approach involved in producing quantitative sequence profiles from mRNA transcripts. ScanPy, a Python-based package for analyzing Single-Cell RNA (scRNA) Seq, was utilized for analysis of Â©MSKCC Isabel acquired patient data with networks developed from MotifMap-RNA acquired RBP datasets. Gene enrichment analysis was also done using GSEApy, to find probabilistic cellular pathways for all genes of interest in HGSOC and TNBC. Overall, 81 novel HGSOC-related RBP target sets were identified from the 6 RBPs of interest discovered within all 41 HGSOC patients. Of the 6 RPBs, 3 proteins were also derived from the IGF2 family which have shown great contribution in increasing the cellular incidence of ovarian cancer. Additionally, identified pathways from TNBC were cross-checked using previous research, to produce an array of targets for every RBP of interest within all 3 TNBC patients.
